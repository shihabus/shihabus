### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Shihabudheen US 

I am a *`JS`* enthusiast. Always love to learn new things and keep updated. By degree I am Electrical engineer, by profession I am coder and by passion I am an atrist. The thoughest question to answer is, what is my hobby. In free time I love to sleep. Not sure how many people buy that as a hobbyðŸ˜†. 

Current I work with **[Dunzo](https://www.dunzo.com/)** as a frontend engineer. 

I ðŸ’» in JavaScript. I have tried out Python, C, C# and C++.

Now I am learning Advanced JS. 

Really crazy about micro-frontends, graphql, security and deno.
