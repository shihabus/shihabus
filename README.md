### 👋 Hi, I am Shihabudheen US  aka Shihab

A JS enthusiast, who always ♥️ loves to learn. 

By degree, I am an Electrical engineer, by profession I am a developer and, by passion I am an artist. The toughest ❓ question to answer would be, about my hobby. In my free time, I love to 😴sleep. Not sure, how many people would buy that as a hobby 😆. 

Currently, I work with [Salesforce]([https://www.dunzo.com/](https://www.salesforce.com/in/) as a frontend engineer 👨‍💻. I help people to achieve their 🚀dreams, I mentor and guide them. 

I code in JavaScript. I have tried out Python, C, C# and C++. Recently got my hands dirty on Go and it is just 🤩. 

Blindly in love with React and React Native. Scratched the tip of Flutter too.

Now I am learning Advanced JS and Vue.js. 

Really 🤯crazy about micro-frontends, GraphQL, project architecture and deno.
