### 👋 Hi, I am Shihabudheen US 

A JS enthusiast who always ♥️love to learn. 

By degree I am Electrical engineer, by profession I am developer and by passion I am an atrist. The thoughest ❓question to answer is, what is my hobby. In free time I love to 😴sleep. Not sure how many people buy that as a hobby😆. 

Current I work with **[Dunzo](https://www.dunzo.com/)** as a frontend engineer 👨‍💻. I help people to achieve their 🚀dreams, I do mentor and guide. 

I code in JavaScript. I have tried out Python, C, C# and C++.

Blindly in love with React and React Native. Scratched the tip of flutter too.

Now I am learning Advanced JS and Vue.js. 

Really 🤯crazy about micro-frontends, graphql, project architecturing and deno.
